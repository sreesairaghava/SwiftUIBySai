# SwiftUI By Sai 🚀

Welcome to **SwiftUI By Sai** —  
A journey through **100 SwiftUI Shorts** covering SwiftUI basics, mini app builds, and iOS frameworks!

Each short will be paired with clean, modular SwiftUI code, made available in this repository for everyone to view, learn, download, and customize.

> ⚡ **Note:** This project is a **Work in Progress**.  
> New content will be uploaded regularly as part of the **100 Shorts** series.

## 🎯 Project Vision

- 📹 **Create 100 Short Videos** (YouTube Shorts) covering iOS and SwiftUI development.
- 🛠 **Organized Source Code** for each video, available publicly.
- 🌎 **Wide Range of Topics** including SwiftUI components, mini app builds, and real-world iOS frameworks.

This is not a strict "daily challenge" — instead, content will be uploaded progressively until we reach 100 unique SwiftUI shorts.
